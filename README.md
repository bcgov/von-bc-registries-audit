# Audit scripts for Aries VCR/OrgBook and BC Registries Issuer

This repository provides scripts to audit the OrgBook search database and agent wallet against the source BC Registries data.

These scripts require access to:

- Source BC Registries COLIN database
- The BC Registries issuer database (to check for future-dated orgs)
- The OrgBook search database
- The OrgBook wallet database

Due to the processing time required to read the OrgBook wallet credentials, the wallet id's are cached in a local text file.  New wallet id's are appended each time the audit script runs.

These scripts all have the option to run against local csv exports of the databases, rather than reading the database in real-time.

## BC Registries / OrgBook Search Database Audit

Run the script as follows:

```bash
BC_REG_DB_USER=<user> \
   BC_REG_DB_PASSWORD=<password> \
   EVENT_PROC_DB_USER=<user> \
   EVENT_PROC_DB_PASSWORD=<password> \
   ... etc ... \
   USE_CSV=false \
   python ./detail_audit_report.py
```

Note that the connection information and credentials must be provided for all target databases.  Defaults are provided in a local [config.py](https://github.com/bcgov/von-bc-registries-audit/blob/master/scripts/config.py) configuration file - the provided defaults will work for a local installation of von-network, OrgBook and the BC Registries issuer.


Database connection information and credentials need to be provided.  The environment variables are included in the above [config.py](https://github.com/bcgov/von-bc-registries-audit/blob/master/scripts/config.py) configuration file.

## OrgBook Search Database / Wallet Audit

Run the script as follows:

```bash
ORGBOOK_DB_PORT=<port> \
   ORGBOOK_DB_USER=<user> \
   ORGBOOK_DB_PASSWORD=<password> \
   ORGBOOK_DB_DATABASE=OrgBook \
   AGENT_API_URL=<acapy admin url>/credential/ \
   AGENT_API_KEY="acapy api key" \
   python ./detail_audit_report_agent.py
```

This script reads and updates an extract of the OrgBook wallet credential id's (since it takes so long to extract these id's).  Each time the script runs it reads this file into an in-memory cache, and then reads each OrgBook credential.  For Credentials with a wallet id not in cache the wallet is queried using the aca-py API url and key, and if the wallet record exists the id is appended to the extract file.

Note that by default this script only compares *non-revoked* credentials (as these are the only credentials that can be verified through the OrgBook API).  To audit *all* credentials specify an additional environment variable:

```bash
AUDIT_ALL_CREDENTIALS=true ... python ./detail_audit_report_agent.py
```

## Running the audit in steps, using exported csv files.

The audit process can be run in steps, where the initial steps extract data from each database, and then the final step reads data from the extracted csv files.  (For example, if you are running locally, want to audit the production databases, and can only port-map one database at a time.)

The steps are:

Port-map the BC Reg COLIN database:

```bash
BC_REG_DB_USER=<user> \
   BC_REG_DB_PASSWORD=<password> \
   python ./detail_audit_report_0.py
```

Port-map the BC Reg issuer database:

```bash
EVENT_PROC_DB_PASSWORD=<password> \
   EVENT_PROC_DB_USER=<user> \
   EVENT_PROC_DB_PASSWORD=<password> \
   EVENT_PROC_DB_PORT=<port> \
   python ./detail_audit_report_1.py
```

Port-map the OrgBook search database:

```bash
ORGBOOK_DB_PORT=<port> \
   ORGBOOK_DB_USER=<user> \
   ORGBOOK_DB_PASSWORD=<password> \
   ORGBOOK_DB_DATABASE=OrgBook \
   python ./detail_audit_report_2.py
```

... and then the final audit step (using all the locally cached csv files) is:

```bash
USE_CSV=true \
   python ./detail_audit_report.py
```

No database information needs to be provided on the last step.


## Understanding the Output

The scripts print out three groups of messages, **Error Messages**, **Management Commands**, and an **Error Summary**.

The **Error Messages** list the details of each of the discrepancies detected by the scripts.

The **Management Commands** list the [orgbook-configurations](https://github.com/bcgov/orgbook-configurations) and/or [von-bc-registries-agent-configurations](https://github.com/bcgov/von-bc-registries-agent-configurations) management commands needed to fix the detected issues.

The **Error Summary** provides a summary of the audit run and is produced whether or not there are any issues detected.

### Corporation number prefixes

The audit uses the same corporation number prefix rules as the BC Registries
agent: numbers starting with `BC`, `C0`, `C1`, or `Q` are preserved. Other numbers
for `BC`, `ULC`, `CC`, and `BEN` types receive a `BC` prefix.
For example, a continued-in benefit company numbered `C1565383` is looked up as
`C1565383`, not `BCC1565383`.

After updating these rules, regenerate any cached COLIN CSV exports before using
`USE_CSV=true`; existing exports contain the previously generated identifiers.

### Management Commands

These can include commands to delete the existing OrgBook data and re-queue the data from the BC Reg issuer.  Commands will look like the following example:

```
./manage -e prod queueOrganization CP0009876
./manage -e prod queueOrganization 3456543
./manage -e prod queueOrganization 3456789
./manage -p bc -e prod deleteTopic BC1234567
./manage -e prod requeueOrganization 1234567
./manage -p bc -e prod deleteTopic BC1234589
./manage -e prod requeueOrganization 1234589
```

In this example, the first 3 lines represent companies missing in OrgBook, and must be queued from BC Reg.

The last 4 lines represent 2 companies in OrgBook that are incorrect and must be deleted and re-processed.

The commands should be run in the order listed, however, if, for some reason, you need to run the commands in a batch, the `orgbook-configurations` scripts should always be run first.

Commands in the following forms should be run using the openshift `./manage` scripts from [orgbook-configurations](https://github.com/bcgov/orgbook-configurations):
- `./manage -p bc -e <env> deleteTopic <business_number>`

Commands in the following forms should be run using the openshift `./manage` scripts from [von-bc-registries-agent-configurations](https://github.com/bcgov/von-bc-registries-agent-configurations):
- `./manage -e <env> queueOrganization <business_number>`
- `./manage -e <env> requeueOrganization <business_number>`

## Running on Docker

The [./manage](./manage) script can be used to build and start a container for running the scripts.  The container was designed for use in OpenShift and by default starts the scripts using a cron tab [audit.conf](./docker/audit.conf).  Once the container is running you can shell into the container and run the scripts manually.  When running in docker add all of your environment variables to the `./env/.env` file.  This file will be created for you the first time you start the container.

When running locally the various databases will have to be port forwarded to your machine.  In order for the container to be able to connect with the databases you will need to specify the host names as `host.docker.internal` and forward the databases to separate ports.

Example:

From the command line (after updating your .env file):
```
./manage build
./manage start
./manage shell audit
```

From the shell inside the container:
```
(app-root) bash-4.4$ cd scripts/
(app-root) bash-4.4$ python ./detail_audit_report.py 
Get corp stats from OrgBook DB 2021-11-22 08:29:49.528329
Get corp stats from BC Registries DB 2021-11-22 08:29:52.320647
...
```

Type `exit` when complete, and then `./manage stop` to stop the container.

## Running in OpenShift

The audit container was designed to be run in OpenShift.  Once configured it runs the scripts on a schedule and posts the results to the `von-notifications` channel in the BCGov rocket.chat instance.

The [openshift-developer-tools](https://github.com/BCDevOps/openshift-developer-tools/tree/master/bin) compatible OpenShift configurations are contained in the [openshift](./openshift) folder.

The [openshift](./openshift) folder also contains a [./manage](./openshift/manage) script that can be used to build and deploy container images from your local source code.

Example (run from the `openshift` folder) - Build and deploy the `dev` and `test`:
```
./manage -e tools buildAndTag dev
./manage -e tools -e tools tag dev test
```

### Updating the ignore list

The deployed audit mounts [scripts/ignore_list.json](./scripts/ignore_list.json)
from the `audit-ignore-list` ConfigMap. Deploying a new image alone does not
refresh this list. After deploying the corrected image, refresh the ConfigMap in
each target namespace and restart the audit deployment (the `subPath` mount does
not receive ConfigMap updates automatically). Run from the repository root:

```bash
oc -n <namespace> create configmap audit-ignore-list \
  --from-file=ignore_list.json=scripts/ignore_list.json \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml | oc -n <namespace> apply -f -
oc -n <namespace> rollout restart deployment/audit
oc -n <namespace> rollout status deployment/audit
```

Remove obsolete `BCC1198486` and `BCC1565383` workarounds rather than ignoring
the correctly numbered companies. Genuine discrepancies, such as a stale legal
type in OrgBook, should still be reported.

## Tests

With [scripts/requirements.txt](./scripts/requirements.txt) installed, run the
prefix and audit-report regression tests from the repository root:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s scripts -p "test_*.py" -v
```

These tests do not connect to databases or send notifications.
